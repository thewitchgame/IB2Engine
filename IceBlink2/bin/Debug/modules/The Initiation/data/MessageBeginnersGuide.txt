<br><br>
CHARACTER CREATION<br>
Some of the most important decisions you make are made within the first few minutes of playing the game. How you make your witch can affect the difficulty of encounters, how often they can use special powers, and how y.<br><br>
<br>
<i>Roll the Right Stats</i><br>
Use a combination of point allocation and Seasons options to tweak the Stats of your characters. More detailed information can be found in the Player’s Guide, but…<br>
…characters who engage in melee combat have Strength scores of at least 14. <br>
…characters who want survivability have bonuses to Dexterity and Constitution.<br>
…characters who want to use Paths effectively and plan to use tactical combat to regain lost SP have Wisdom scores of at least 14. RECOMMENDED.<br>
…characters who want to level up quickly have Charisma scores of at least 14.<br>
…characters who use Powers frequently have Intelligence scores of at least 14. RECOMMENDED. <br>
 <br>
<i>Pick the Right Paths</i><br>
For first-time young witches, Folk Magic and Natural Philosophy provide the most straightforward benefits for high Wisdom and Intelligence characters. Woodcraft, Warding, and Swordplay are useful for witches who want to experiment with different synergies. 
<br><br>
ADVENTURING</i><br>
Interacting with the game world is easy, but keeping in mind a few things about it can improve your experience.<br>
<br>
<i>Arm Your Witch</i><br>
Equip the items you have in your inventory. Many weapons and armor give small bonuses or penalties to Stats. Pay attention to these and optimize your characters accordingly. The witch should begin by equipping Pharaoh (the crow) and his kernels.<br>
<br>
<i>Save Your Game</i><br>
Disaster can strike at any time. Save your game often and keep multiple saves.<br>
<br>
<i>Turn On the Music</i><br>
It's important.<br>
<br>
<i>Explore Everything</i><br>
The game offers lots of secrets, side quests, and non-critical conversations. Some things are meant to be rewarding in themselves, and others are opportunities for XP growth or treasure.<br> 
<br>
<i>Read Your Journal</i><br>
If you’re stuck or forget what you have to do, review your journal by clicking on the book icon at the bottom of the screen.<br>
<br>
COMBAT<br>
Combat can be challenging, but a little knowledge goes a long way. Consult the Player’s Guide for more detailed information.<br>
<br>
<i>Don’t Move Away From Enemies</i><br>
Moving away from enemies right beside you provokes free attacks.<br>
<br>
<i>Use SP Wisely</i><br>
It’s easy to burn through SP too fast, especially at low levels. Make sure you’re getting the most out of healing spells and that Powers that can have multiple targets hit as many as possible.<br>
<br>
<i>Use Ranged Weapons from Far Away</i><br>
Why get close if you don’t have to?<br>
<br>
<i>One at a Time</i><br>
While it may be tempting to spread out damage (and some characters excel at doing just that), it is often best to focus on one foe.<br>
<br>
<i>Take Advantage of Vulnerabilities</i><br>
Enemies with low HP and enemies who have had their defenses weakened make excellent targets. Also, attacking targets from behind offers a significant bonus to attacks with melee weapons.<br>
