1. CHARACTER CREATION<br>

 

In Malkin, you create one character -- the young witch -- at the beginning of the game. Your choices in character creation have a big impact on your experience later.
<br>
 <br>
<br>
1.a. NAME<br>

Choose any name for your character. Non-player characters in the game (NPCs) sometimes call the young witch by their name.
<br>
 <br>
<br>
1.b. PORTRAIT<br>

You should choose two portraits for your character. The head portrait represents the young witch on maps, while the bust portrait represents them on the character sheet.

<br> 
<br>
<br>
1.c. SEASON<br>

Witches sometimes choose to identify with one of the four seasons. This identity gives a unique set of bonuses and penalties to character Stats (1.f.) and Damage Resistance. Witches who aren't particular about the time of year get a +1 bonus to all Stats and no Damage Resistance.

1.d. GENDER<br>

Gender affects the pronouns used to refer to the young witch.
<br>
 <br>
 <br>

1.e. CLASS<br>

There's only one class in the game for the main character -- witch. But don't worry, being a witch is great.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Witch</i><br>

Witches have many powers. They can summon short-lived minions, call on the elements to deal damage to their enemies, curse their enemies, and heal themselves and their allies. The young witch also adventures with a crow familiar named Pharaoh, who is trained to attack with deadly accuracy and afflict foes with a minor hex. Witches are not naturally skilled front-line combatants, but there are exceptions.
<br>
 <br>

Starting HP/HP per level: 14/+1<br>

Starting SP/SP per level: 7/+1<br>

Base Attack Bonus, Levels 1-9: 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4<br>

Base Fortitude Save: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2<br>

Base Reflex Save: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2<br>

Base Will Save: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6<br>

Spells Per Level: 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1<br>
<br>
 <br>


1.f. STATS<br>

Stats represent the intellectual and physical potential of the young witch. Each Stat has an important mechanical impact on the game -- during combat, mostly, but also during certain narrative encounters. During character creation, the player has a pool of points to distribute to their Stats. During the game, the young witch might also find equipment that adjusts Stats. Scores less than 9 give penalties, while scores higher than 11 offer bonuses. For more detailed information on how bonuses and penalties from Stats help determine the success of actions in combat, see Section 3.e. For more information on how bonuses and penalties from Stats help determine the success of actions outside combat, see Sections 2.c. and 2.d.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Strength</i><br>

Strength determines how frequently a character successfully hits enemies with weapon-based melee attacks and how much damage these attacks do. It also reflects the young witch's athletic prowess and gives her an advantage in certain narrative encounters.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Dexterity</i><br>

Dexterity determines how frequently a character successfully hits enemies with weapon-based ranged attacks and how much damage these attacks do. The bonus from Dexterity is also applied directly to a character’s Armor Class or AC (3.e.), Reflex Save (3.e.), and Initiative rolls (3.b.).
<br>
 <br>

<i>Constitution</i><br>

The bonus from Constitution is directly applied to a character’s Fortitude Save (3.e.). Every time the character gains a level (2.f.), this bonus is also added directly to the character’s total Hit Points or HP, a measure of how much damage a character can take before falling in battle.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Intelligence</i><br>

The bonus from Intelligence is directly applied to a character’s Will Save (3.e.). Every time the character gains a level (2.f.), this bonus is also added directly to the character’s total SP, the resource Powers (1.h.) use in battle.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Wisdom</i><br>

All Paths (1.g.) use Wisdom to determine success or failure in narrative encounters. During combat, Wisdom affects how much SP the young witch receives from destroying special enemies like Elf Candles and Discordium Fragments. 
<br>
 <br>

<i>Charisma</i><br>

Charisma is less the young witch's personality than it is her unique blend of luck, grace, and savvy. It affects how much experience she receives from quests and battles, and it also reduces how much dross she has to spend to purchase items from the game's merchant.
<br>
 <br>

1.g. PATHS<br>

The young witch commits to two paths at the beginning of her journey. These paths help define the witch's expertise and role in combat. All Paths come with low-cost Powers that can be used in combat as Swift Actions (3.d.). 
<br>
 <br>

1.h. POWERS<br>

The young witch's Powers come, not surprisingly, from witchcraft. Traits and special equipment can also give a character Powers. Powers are special abilities that cost SP to use and have a variety of potentially game-changing effects.
<br>
 <br>

1.i. ADDING AND REMOVING CHARACTERS<br>

To begin the game, you need to make a single character. Cycle through the available characters using the arrow keys and click Add or Remove to choose the one you want.
<br>
 <br>

2. ADVENTURING
<br>
<br>
 

2.a. MOVEMENT AND TIME<br>

You can move in the game’s non-combat maps by using arrow keys. Alternatively, click on the ship’s wheel icon to bring up a mouse-controlled movement panel. In most non-combat areas, passing into a square takes one minute of game time. Light brown arrows help guide the witch to new areas. Sometimes, the narrative accelerates or freezes time. The young witch must be mindful of the time; her task has to be completed before August 1.
<br>
<br> 

2.b. THE MAP OF THE WOODS<br>

As the young witch explores the woods, landmarks will be added to her map. To use the map, use it in from the inventory screen (see 2.e.). Once opened, the young witch can move to landmarks she's discovered without spending as much time as she would walking normally, though there's always a chance that she will be waylaid or get lost. The Woodcraft Path (1.g.) reduces the amount of time further and also makes it less likely that she will be waylaid or get lost.

<br> 
<br>
2.c. CONVERSATIONS<br>

To interact with a character, move over the NPC. If the character has something to say, a conversation initiates. Some conversations take place automatically. Not all conversations involve other characters. Sometimes, conversations are simply narrated events.
<br>
 <br>

Many NPCs in Malkin evolve over the course of the game. They don’t always populate the same areas, and they don’t always have the same things to say.
<br>
 <br>

Sometimes, Paths (1.g.) or Stats (1.f.) give the young witch an opportunity to benefit from the situation or learn important information. If this is the case, the triggering Path or Stat will be bracketed. A bracketed option doesn’t necessarily mean success, though. The game will check to see if a score -- usually Wisdom -- is high enough.
<br>
 <br>

2.d. ENCOUNTERS<br>

A pulsating blue light in an area represents an opportunity for the party to have an encounter. These encounters can be advantageous, disadvantageous, or neither; they can lead to narrative encounteres or combat ones; some are critical, and some are random.
<br>
 <br>

2.e. EQUIPMENT<br>

The young witch begins with a few items, including the Map of the Woods (2.b.), her crow familiar, and some robes. Most equipment must be found.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Merchant</i><br>

There is only one merchant in Malkin, and she trades in dross, not gold.
<br>
 
<br>
<i>Clothing, Armor, Weapons, and Ammo</i><br>

Clothing, armor, weapons, and ammunition must all be equipped to be used in combat. To equip an item, access the character sheet screen by clicking on the bust icon. On the character sheet screen, click on the part of the adventurer you want to equip. For example, if you want to equip a longsword, click on the right hand: the adventurer uses the right hand to swing (there are no left-handed characters). Only items that can be equipped in the chosen slot appear in the pop-up menu. Note that some characters can’t equip some items: these won’t appear in the pop-up menu.  
<br>
 
<br>
Ranged weapons require ammunition. Having a ranged weapon equipped and the appropriate ammunition (kernels, for Pharaoh) in your inventory isn’t enough: you must equip the ammunition by clicking on the ammunition icon.
<br>
 <br>


<i>Usable Items</i><br>

Some items -- Adventurer's Tonic, for example -- can be used in the way Powers are used in combat. Such items do not need to be equipped. To use an item in this way, access the inventory via the sack icon during combat to select it. 
<br>
 <br>

<i>2.f. LEVELING UP</i><br>

Characters gain Experience Points (XP) from completing quests and tasks, winning battles, discovering things, and making insightful remarks. Once a certain XP threshold has been reached (see below), the character gains a level, becoming more powerful and gaining one new Power. (See 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h. for more details.) To level up, click the plus icon that appears on the bust portrait.
<br>
 <br>

Experience needed to reach…<br>

…Level 1: 0<br>

…Level 2: 180<br>

…Level 3: 450<br>

…Level 4: 810<br>

…Level 5: 1350<br>

…Level 6: 2070<br>

…Level 7: 2970<br>

…Level 8: 3960<br>

…Level 9: 4140<br> 
<br>
 <br>

2.g. JOURNAL<br>

Clicking on the open book icon opens the journal. The journal keeps track of quests the young witch has received and other important data. Each item in the list on the left side of the screen may include multiple entries. Cycle through these entries using the left and right arrow keys.

 <br>
<br>
2.h. ADVENTURE MAP SETTINGS<br>

Settings can be adjusted via toggles on the lower left side of the screen. The grid paper toggle turns the walkable and nonwalkable grid overlay off and on. The hourglass icon turns the calendar and time display off and on. The lyre icon turns the music off and on.
<br>
 <br>

2.i. SAVING THE GAME<br>

To save the game, click on the hard drive icon. You should use multiple slots for saved games in case something goes wrong.
<br>
 <br>

3. COMBAT<br>
<br>
 <br>

3.a. DEPLOYMENT<br>

By default, characters appear in certain positions on the combat map automatically.
<br>
 <br>

3.b. INITIATIVE<br>

At the beginning of combat, the game generates a number between 1 and 20 for each participant. This is called an Initiative roll. NPCs have an Initiative statistic that can increase or decrease this value. The game uses PCs' Dexterity bonuses (1.f.) to adjust their Initiative rolls; higher is better. The highest roller goes first, then the second, and so on, for each participant in the battle. Turn order can be reviewed via the Initiative Bar at the top of the screen.
<br>
 <br>

3.c. COMBAT TIME AND ACTION TYPES<br>

One combat round is supposed to represent about six seconds of narrative time. In game terms, a round of combat is the time it takes for each participant to take a turn and use actions.
<br>
<br>
Anything a PC does to change the game state in some way counts as a kind of action.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Standard Action</i><br>

A Standard Action is an action into which the PC is putting all their time. Taking a Standard Action ends the character’s turn. Normal attacks, using most powers, and even skipping one’s turn count as Standard Actions.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Swift Action</i><br>

A Swift Action is an action that can be performed efficiently enough not to end the PC’s turn. Paths (1.g.) grant Powers that take advantage of Swift Actions, and a few Powers can be used as Swift Actions, too. A PC can only make 1 Swift Action per turn.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Free Action</i><br>

A Free Action is an action that can be performed very efficiently – so efficiently that there is no limit on the number of free actions a PC can perform in combat. Free actions aren’t very common, but a few Powers are free actions, and certain items allow them, too (2.e.).

 <br>
<br>
<i>Movement</i><br>

Unless afflicted by Immobility or Paralysis, a character can always move into an unblocked square. Movement must take place before the PC uses a Standard Action.
<br>
 <br>

3.d. COMBAT OPTIONS<br>

Players engage in battle using the first seven large icons on the combat screen.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Character Sheet/Switching Weapons</i><br>

The player can access the character sheet in the same way on the combat map as on the adventuring map, by clicking the bust icon. This can be useful simply for checking a character’s statistics and active effects. A PC can also be change weapons via the character sheet (see 2.e.). 
<br>
 <br>

<i>Inventory</i><br>

The player can access the inventory screen in the same way on the combat map as on the adventuring map, by clicking the sack icon. This is how to access usable items like Adventurer’s Tonics (2.e.).
<br>
 <br>

<i>Skip</i><br>

If you find that nothing you do could change the game state to your advantage, you can choose to Skip a PC’s turn. Skipping is a Standard Action (3.c.).
<br>
 <br>

<i>Move</i><br>

As noted above, characters unafflicted by Immobility or Paralysis can always move into an unblocked square. All characters have the ability to move 5 squares by default, but equipment and certain powers can modify this number. Moving diagonally counts as moving 1.5 squares. You can move with the arrow keys; alternatively, click the ship’s wheel icon to bring up the mouse-controlled movement panel. A character’s available movement is tracked via the grayed-out button between the ship’s wheel icon and the Trait button.
<br>
 
<br>
Moving away from an enemy in combat gives that enemy the opportunity to attack the PC for free. It’s a good idea not to move away from nearby enemies unless you’re confident you can handle it. PCs get free attacks on enemy NPCs who do the same thing.
<br>
 
<br>
Finally, while a character cannot enter a square in which another character is standing, an unconscious PC does not restrict movement in this way. In some instances, therefore -- if another party member restores consciousness to a fallen comrade, for example -- two characters will occupy the same square.

 <br>
<br>
<i>Attack</i><br>

When a PC attacks with a common melee weapon, the target must be within 1 square. Certain uncommon melee weapons have a range of 2; in that case, the target must be within 2 squares.
<br>
 <br>

When a PC attacks with a ranged weapon, the target must be within the range specified by the weapon. 
<br>
 
<br>
The player selects attack and chooses a valid target, then clicks to execute the attack. An attack is a Standard Action (3.c.). For more information on how the success of an attack is determined, see 3.e.
<br>
 
<br>
<i>Power</i><br>

To access Powers, use this button. Powers given by Paths are accessed via the Paths button. The Power screen has valuable information about targeting, Action type, effects, and cost.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Path</i><br>

To access Paths that come with combat Powers, use this button. The Path screen has valuable information about targeting, Action type, effects, and cost.

 <br>
<br>
3.e. ATTACK, POWER, AND DEFENSE MECHANICS
<br>
Rarely are Attacks and Powers automatically successful. This section describes how the game determines the success of these actions.
<br>
 <br>

The core mechanic of this process is to randomly generate a number between 1 and 20, the higher the better. Bonuses are often added to this number.

<br> 
<br>
For attacks made with melee and ranged weapons, this number is generated for the attacker and compared to the target’s Armor Class (AC). If the result equals or is higher than the AC of the target, the attack is succesful and damage is determined (3.f.).
<br>
 <br>

For Powers, this number is generated for each defender and compared to the Difficulty Class (DC) of the Power. This is called a saving throw or “save,” and it is modified by the Reflex, Will, or Fortitude values of the target character. If the result equals or is higher than the DC of the Power, the Power doesn’t take effect (or doesn’t take effect with full force).
<br>
 
<br>
3.f. DAMAGE<br>

There are seven different damage types in the game, Physical, Electricity, Fire, Cold, Poison, Acid, and Magical. The most common type of damage is Physical Damage. Most weapons, for instance, deal Physical Damage exclusively.
<br>
 
<br>
Each character in the game has the potential to resist or to become susceptible to a certain damage type, and many have innate resistances or susceptibilities. Resistance is tracked as a percentage.
<br>
 
<br>
A positive value (20% Acid Resistance, for example) means that 20% of all damage done by a certain damage type wouldn’t harm the character. Using the example above, this means that 10 Acid Damage becomes 8 Acid Damage. Fractions are rounded down. If a character has a paltry 3% Physical Resistance, 1 Physical Damage does no damage to them at all.

 <br>
<br>
A negative resistance value (-20% Acid Resistance, for example) means that the damage done by a certain damage type increases. Using the example above, this means that 10 Acid Damage becomes 12 Acid Damage.  
<br>
 
<br>
The game rarely uses a flat number to determine damage from an attack. Instead, Weapons and Powers use a dice-based system to randomly determine damage: the game rolls a number of invisible dice, adds up their value, and the result is the damage output. These theoretical dice are abbreviated as 1d6, 3d4, 1d8 + 3, and so on. The first number stands for the number of dice being rolled and the last number for the type of die being rolled. A 1d6 is therefore one six-sided die, and 3d4 stands for three four-sided dice. Sometimes, as in the example 1d8 + 3, a flat number is added to the randomly generated sum.
<br>
 <br>

3.g. RESOLUTION<br>

All battles have victory conditions, even if the condition is simply to destroy all enemies. Most combats in Malkin can be won in either two ways: a) destroy all the enemies or b) reach a target square with a character you control. After combat, a conversation starts narrating the aftermath of the fight. Characters’ HP and SP are restored, even if they were knocked out in the battle, and there is sometimes treasure to be had.
<br>
 
<br>
If all the characters fall in battle, the game is over.

 <br>
<br>
3.h. COMBAT MAP SETTINGS<br>

Settings can be adjusted via toggles on the lower left side of the screen.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Grid Paper</i><br>

The grid paper toggle turns the walkable, nonwalkable, and line-of-sight grid overlay off and on.
<br>
 <br>

<i>Blood</i><br>

The blood droplet toggle turns the HP display for combat participants off and on.
<br>
 
<br>
<i>Lightning</i><br>

The lightning toggle turns the SP display for combat participants off and on.
<br>
<br>
<i>Boot</i><br>

The boot toggle increases and decreases how quickly the game represents movement (1x, 2x, 4x, and 10x).
<br>
 <br>

<i>Snake</i><br>

The snake toggle increases and decreases how quickly the game represents attack and Power actions (1x, 2x, 4x, and 10x).
<br>
 <br>

<i>Lyre</i><br>

The lyre toggle turns the music on and off.

 <br>
<br>
<i>Horn</i><br>

The horn toggle turns sound effects on and off.
<br>
<br>
