~gaShowMessageBox("I hope you?re reading this. I left the woods to look for you. I?ve been terrified, terrified something?s happened to you. Terrified you might have abandoned me. I looked for the witches but found nothing. Maybe you are safe with them. But for some reason I don?t think so. I have this dread. These past few days I can?t bring myself to do anything but search. This morning I couldn?t string my bow. My fingers wouldn?t do it. I haven?t cried since I was a little girl, but I?ve been crying every night. A big pit opens in my chest and as it widens I rock back and forth with grief. Where are you, where are you? What happened? I?ll be back before too long. I can?t bear the thought of you coming to look for me and finding me gone. That's what this letter's for. You're welcome to stay here. Please do.")
